    <p>So for a while now I've been trying to get around to creating a new 
       website for myself. Like any creative, you sometimes need to scratch
       your own itch and build something for yourself. This website is a 
       rolling development of a piece of software I'm calling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank" rel="external">Pareto</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The Pareto principle (also known as the 80–20 rule, the law of the 
           vital few, and the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for 
           many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I needed a system not only for myself but for future client work. It 
       needs to do 80% of the boilerplate work I write for most projects and
       be modular and extensible enough to tack-on additional functionality 
       as my own whims or client requirements see fit. Not only this, I need
       to easily deploy and provision any services (databases, logging, email).
       For about eighteen months now I've been in love with <a href="http://appharbor.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">AppHarbor</a>, a 
       cloud-based SaaS for .NET web applications that allows easy 
       provisioning of add-ons and scaling loads.</p>
    <p>I'll be documenting the features of Pareto over on <abbr title="Abandoned!">this page</abbr> over the 
       next few weeks as I sand off the edges and eventually I will open up 
       the source to Pareto so that other developers can benefit from the 
       power of the Pareto principle. At the moment I'm thinking free for 
       non-commercial usage/deployment and a fee for commercial licencing. 
       Who knows. Either way, I'm dogfooding Pareto right now with this site
       and it's looking pretty good!</p>

        <p>If you're here on this <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">GitHub Pages</a>
           hosted site it, it kinda tells you that Pareto didn't suit my needs.</p>
