        <blockquote>
            <p>The testing and monitoring of elite athletes in their natural training
       environment is becoming an area of interest to the sporting community.
       Specialised equipment is cumbersome and influences the training and 
       analysis regimens athletes undertake to improve their performance. 
       Ubiquitous and off-the-shelf versatile smartphones with advanced 
       sensing capabilities can be applied to sports activity monitoring, 
       providing a cost-effective means of widespread performance analysis.
       This paper briefly outlines the case for using these smartphones in 
       sports monitoring applications, presents a model to collect data 
       generated by these devices and presents the results of real-world usage
       when applied to cricket.</p>
