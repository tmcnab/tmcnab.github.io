<p>Back in 2010 I went on down to Melbourne to give a talk on iOS device 
   sensing for /dev/world/2010 on behalf of the Apple University Consortium
   (AUC). While it went well enough for my first public presentation, I 
   certainly learned the lesson that you really need a lot of preparation
   and rehearsal before the event. Besides rambling for a good portion of
   the presentation, one of my biggest mistakes was trying to be fancy and
   making code change brightness/color when going over it to the audience.
   This proved to be a bad idea because the room was partially lit, and the
   interplay of shadows and lighting wrecked the effect I was going for.</p>

<p>Not bad I suppose, but I can't stand to hear myself talk.</p>
