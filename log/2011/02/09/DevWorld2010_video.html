        <p>Back in 2010 I went on down to Melbourne to give a talk on iOS 
           device sensing for /dev/world/2010 on behalf of the <abbr title="Apple University Consortium">AUC</abbr>.
           While it went well enough for my first public presentation, I 
           certainly learned the lesson that you really need a lot of preparation
           and rehearsal before the event. Besides rambling for a good portion of
           the presentation, one of my biggest mistakes was trying to be fancy and
           making code change brightness/color when going over it to the audience.
           This proved to be a bad idea because the room was partially lit, and the
           interplay of shadows and lighting wrecked the effect I was going for.</p>
        <p>Not bad I suppose, but I can't stand to hear myself talk.</p>
