<p>Seditious Technologies opens its doors today and the future looks great. 
   Instead of prosaically defining our ideals and goals like giant smug 
   douches through paragraphs of long-windedness, here’s three points that
   you need to know about us:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We’re a two-man software developer/designer team with experiences in a wide array of languages and technologies</li>
    <li>We’re open to taking on clients with eclectic software development requirements (MATLAB on Rails? Sure thing!)</li>
    <li>We build software that we want to use and built right the first time</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we’re a consulting and product company, we’re working on a number of 
   software products that are going to help users get work done faster and 
   with as little hassle as possible. Watch this space in a few days as we’ll
   be announcing our first product. Here’s a hint of what’s in store:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>You can program iOS apps in Objective-C, C, C++, C#, Javascript, Actionscript
       etc., but you really need to be a developer to fully understand the underlying platform.</p>
    <p>What about artists and designers? Won’t somebody think of the artists!?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trust us, it’s pretty cool.</p>
