<p>We've been searching for a great product idea to kick-off our little enterprise.
   We've come across that idea, developed it a bit, and now we’re showing it to you
   (be gentle!). <a href="//processing.org" target="_blank" rel="external">Processing</a> is a visual design language developed a few years ago 
   by some cool MIT dudes:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Processing is an open source programming language and <abbr="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> 
       built for the electronic arts and visual design communities with the purpose
       of teaching the basics of computer programming in a visual context, and to
       serve as the foundation for electronic sketchbooks &hellip; One of the stated aims
       of Processing is to act as a tool to get non-programmers started with 
       programming, through the instant gratification of visual feedback.</p>
    <small>Wikipedia</small>
</blockquote>
<p>Processing can run on the big three desktop operating systems, on old-school 
   J2ME cell phones, on Android smartphones and in the browser as an applet. 
   Thanks to the guys at <a href="//luckybite.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">LuckyBite</a> 
   we have hacky way of putting Processing on the iOS platform with <a href="//luckybite.com/iprocessing/" target="_blank" rel="external">iProcessing</a>.
   iProcessing is similar to products like Appcelerator Titanium and PhoneGap, 
   whereby a Processing.js sketch is embedded within a normal UIWebView and 
   compiled against a wrapper project. The downside of this approach is that:</p>
<ol>
    <li>If you’re a Processing user who has grown to love the Processing IDE, XCode can be intimidating if you have to do anything fancy or modify the template provided</li>
    <li>Your code is running on the old Mobile Safari JS engine, not the new and sexy Nitro with JIT</li>
    <li>WebGL isn’t a part of Mobile Safari (and by extension a UIWebView), so doing 3D stuff is out of the question</li>
</ol>
<p>So basically it all boils down to the fact that while it’s great for simple 
   sketches, complex sketches cannot currently be written for iOS. Which is a 
   shame, because like Steve says, it’s freaking magical. So that’s the problem,
   and we’re working on a solution. What we have going right now, as you’ll see
   down in the video below, is a proof-of-concept for getting Processing onto 
   iOS in a fully-native way:</p>
<div class="row-fluid" style="padding-bottom:20px;">
    <video src="/files/video/processing_for_ios.mp4" controls="controls" class="span6 offset3" preload="metadata" />
</div>
<p>We still have a long way to go before shipping. The API is going to be as
   close to the open-source version as much as possible, but invariably there
   will be differences because of the nature of the platform. We’re really 
   looking forward to see what people will do with Processing on touch devices,
   because they both seem right for each other. Freaking magical indeed.</p>
