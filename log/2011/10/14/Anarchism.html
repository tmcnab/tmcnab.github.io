<p>It may not be widely known but I am an Anarchist. When someone comes out 
   and says this, the first thing that may come to mind is violent rioters
   in black vandalising storefronts as has been the case with many of the 
   anti-globalization / G20 protests. No, this isn’t what anarchism is all
   about. Anarchism in its simplest terms means without leaders or ruling 
   classes. Anarchism when practiced without coercion is really a nice system
   of living: live your life, don’t tread on me and I won’t tread on you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the reason we’re all stuck on this dumb rock is that capital
   flows mainly in one direction these days: up towards those with the 
   majority of it. The reason the Occupy X movement has been gaining ground in
   the United States is that with 10+% unemployment (more for other elements of
   society), crippling debt and the incredulous sums paid out to financial 
   institutions for acting illegally, the poor are becoming poorer and the 
   richer are becoming richer. Besides the degradation in workers rights, the 
   influence of money in the political process and the ever growing 
   totalitarian police state, people are waking up to the fact they are getting
   screwed over from cradle to the grave.</p>
<p>It’s not as bad here in Australia. We enjoy a fairly robust political system
   (not to be confused with the current policies and leadership of those 
   currently in government) and workers rights are fairly good (thanks to the 
   abolition of Work Choices). Unionism is on the decline, the same unionism
   that gave us the rights we have at work now. All in all, we’ve got it pretty
   good, but isn’t it better to strive for something even better?</p>
<p>I’m planning on turning-out to the Occupy Brisbane protest tomorrow to gauge
   the feelings of those who want to make things better (hopefully a valid 
   supposition). As such, I've thrown together a little primer on anarchism 
   (embedded below) that tries to get tongues wagging with some general 
   information and some questions that should spur discussion. I’m no ideologue,
   just an engineer with some hopes and some ideas, so don’t think this is the
   be-all and end-all of what anarchism is about.</p>
