<p>So I whipped-up a rough flight controller for <a href="http://www.flightgear.org/">FlightGear</a>
   using <a href="https://code.google.com/p/accelerometer-simulator">Accelerometer-Simulator</a>
  (AccSim) and Mono. With this bridging application, you can control the roll
  and pitch of your aircraft using any iOS device that can run AccSim. One 
  caveat right now is that, at least on my machine, it chugs the system down
  to one frame per second. I have a feeling that this has something to do with
  the way FlightGear's internal modelling system runs, or it's because I'm 
  continually shoving data down it's throat as fast as the socket will allow
  &hellip; but that's an optimization for another day.</p>
<p>The provided socket interface to FlightGear is pretty neat, and I could 
   definitely see creating a native app on the horizon if I thought there was
   any interest or money in it. Being able to control your autopilot, flight 
   controls and aircraft systems through an iOS device would be pretty sweet.</p>
