Hi, I'm Tristan and welcome to my internet home. 

Professionally I'm a full-stack web developer and computer engineer who can build everything from the gate-level up to the chip, then the system, the operating system and finally user space.

Privately I'm exactly the same but I also play video games, have a family and I like shooting guns.
