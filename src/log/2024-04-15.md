# re/creation

I've used a lot of blogging software over the years lying to myself that I need a blog to establish myself as a proper programmer. From Wordpress to Ghost, Jekyll and other static site generation frameworks - even my own homebrew "solutions" have generated too much friction for repeated, regular use.

For the past year I've been using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) for pretty much all my private project documentation. To be honest, it's a fucking solid foundation for a multitude of literary structures. Look at me here shoehorning it into a personal website.

In any case, after many years of ignoring this creative outlet I've decided to resurrect it. It's not only a developer blog but an outlet for my ennui and anger at the current socioeconomic and technologic order in which the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, rights are rolled back and rubes invest billions in _Artificial Intelligence_ which we in the know really know is just complicated statistics.
