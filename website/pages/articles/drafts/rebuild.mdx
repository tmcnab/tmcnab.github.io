It's been a long time since I've written anything in my weblog. With excuses
like "it's been too long since the last entry", or "I'm just some asshole on
the internet now, who would listen to what I have to say", or the most 
outlandish one: "I need to rewrite the thing from scratch and start anew". 

So that's what I'm doing here. I've rebuilt the entire site from scratch using
[next.js](nextjs.org), [typescript](typescriptlang.org) and [mdx](mdxjs.com).
